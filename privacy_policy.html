Such an offer wall may appear in our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to other persons and will leave our application(s). A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> 5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> In short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> 7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> 8.

You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (V) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> Account Information</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> 	• Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at jujujujuju336@gmail.com.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> 9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognising or honouring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> </div><div style="white-space:pre-line;"> 10.
